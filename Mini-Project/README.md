Inital TO-DO:
1. Will have to merge with gapminder
    - Gapminder data is in long format, change excel to long and merge
2. Filter for year > 1945
3. Q1:plot lines for each continent for gdp vs life exp for 2018 (refer rmd for 09-17)
4. Q2:plot lines for each continent for time vs life exp (refer rmd for 09-17)
5. Looks like trivariate, will have to read.

In question 1, add the graph from class on 09/17 and should axis be changed?

Some ideas about q3 (from 09/19 plot)
- Facet plot by continent, (slope for lifeexp vs gdp) vs time (Secret weapon) (can do with correlation)
- Group into times (for e.g.- 1945-1965), different curves for lifeexp vs gdp facetted by continent
