# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Repo for STAT S-670 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Class 

Inital TO-DO:
1. Will have to merge with gapminder
    - Gapminder data is in long format, change excel to long and merge
2. Filter for year > 1945
3. Q1:plot lines for each continent for gdp vs life exp for 2018 (refer rmd for 09-17)
4. Q2:plot lines for each continent for time vs life exp (refer rmd for 09-17)
5. Looks like trivariate, will have to read.
